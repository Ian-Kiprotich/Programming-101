Computer Program
Computers can read text and understand it in many different ways.
A computer program is just some text we write for the purpose of having the computer translate it into instructions that the computer will perform after that.

The story begins with you writing that text, for example:

Add 5 to 2 then print the result to the screen
You write that text in a language; we call it a programming language. 
The language I used above is just English. 
We need to use one of the programming languages that computers can understand, like Java, Python, or JavaScript.
